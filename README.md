# Course Manager

Course Manager is an MVC web app that allows data on courses and students to be viewed, managed, and saved in a relational database.
All students have enrollment data with new students starting as 'enrollment confirmation not sent.' The web app allows emails to be sent 
to all students and their corresponding email addresses; that email will include a link that allows students to accept or reject course enrollment
and their choice will ultimately be updated in the database and displayed. 

A view of all courses in the database allowing users to add new courses or update an existing one:

The 'manage course' view or the 'See Sharp' course displays all its students and allows more to be added:
